MAI â€“ Motherly AI with Hugging Face Integration

MAI, short for Motherly AI, is an emotionally-aware app companion designed to support  a person checking in with themselves, staying organized, and feeling encouraged. It combines modern AI tools with a warm, human-centered experience. Users can either chat with MAI to reflect on their mood or take a short quiz that gives them insight into their well-being. The app allows them to create a profile where they can track their emotional check-ins and quiz results over time, with a stretch goal of being able to incorporate the persons info to make better predictive alerts and calendar updates for the user.
